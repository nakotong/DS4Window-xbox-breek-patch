# DS4Windows

Like those other ds4tools, but sexier.

DS4Windows is a portable program that allows you to get the best DualShock 4 experience on your PC. By emulating a Xbox 360 controller, many more games are accessible.

You can find the latest and older versions [here](https://github.com/Ryochan7/DS4Windows/releases).

This project is a fork of the work of Jays2Kings. You can find the old project
website at [ds4windows.com](http://ds4windows.com).

## Requirements

- [Microsoft .NET 4.5.2 or higher (needed to unzip the driver and for macros to work properly)](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42642)
- SCP Virtual Bus Driver (Downloaded & Installed with DS4Windows)
- Microsoft 360 Driver (link inside DS4Windows, already installed on Windows 7 SP1 and higher or if you've used a 360 controller before)

- Micro USB cable
- (Optional)Bluetooth 2.1+, via adapter or built in pc [(My recommendation)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LNXO28/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (Toshiba's bluetooth & Bluetooth adapters using CSR currently does not work)
