This is a little tool for those who have xbox controller with a breek plugin and want to play the games with motion control. As breek plugin can make the xbox controller a PS4 controller, the motion data from a PS4 controller can be mapped to a UDP port in order to provide the motion data to the emulator, like cemu.

But the DS4Windows patch cannot be used as the calibration is not set for this circumstance, I changed some calibration data to make it possible.

For other issues, refer to the original website at https://github.com/rajkosto/DS4Windows.

And this tool is not mine, I just shared this idea. Thanks to him, who created this gadget.

To know how this tool works, please refer to the two pictures in the main directory.
