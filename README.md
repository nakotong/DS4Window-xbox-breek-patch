This is a little tool for those who have a xbox elite controller with a Brook plugin and want to play the games with the gyroscope. As the Brook plugin can make the xbox controller a PS4 controller, the motion data from a PS4 controller can be mapped to the UDP port in order to provide the motion data to the emulator, like cemu.

But the DS4Windows patch cannot be used directly as the calibration is not set up appropriately for this circumstance, I changed some calibration data to make it possible.

For other issues, refer to the original website at https://github.com/rajkosto/DS4Windows.

To know how to connect the xbox with the computer via Brook gadgets, please refer to the two pictures in the main directory. The mode of the Breed plugin should be turned into PS4.
